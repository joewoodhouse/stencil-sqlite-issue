# Reproduction Instruction

Run `npm run working` to see the working version using Stencil v4.12.1 - nothing interesting happens. 
Run `npm run broken` to see the broken version using v4.12.2 (the npm script installs the correct version). Open the console and see issues relating to the mounting/initialisation of the jeep-sqlite component
